1. Differentiate arrow functions and regular functions.

Arrow functions and regular functions are two types of functions in JavaScript. The main differences are:
Syntax: Arrow functions use a concise syntax with a 'fat arrow' (=>) to define the function, while regular functions use the 'function' keyword.

'this' keyword: Arrow functions do not bind their own 'this' context, but inherit it from the enclosing scope. Regular functions create their own 'this' context based on how they are called.

'arguments' object: Arrow functions do not have their own 'arguments' object, but can use the 'arguments' object of the enclosing scope. Regular functions have their own 'arguments' object.


2. Write any three different ways to get an element from DOM? 

Here are three different ways to get an element from the DOM in JavaScript:

By ID: Use the 'getElementById' method to get an element by its ID. For example, to get an element with ID 'my-element', use:
javascript


const element = document.getElementById('my-element');

By class name: Use the 'getElementsByClassName' method to get an array-like collection of elements with the same class name. For example, to get all elements with class name 'my-class', use:
javascript


const elements = document.getElementsByClassName('my-class');
By tag name: Use the 'getElementsByTagName' method to get an array-like collection of elements with the same tag name. For example, to get all 'div' elements, use:
javascript


const elements = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
